## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**creationNumber** | **String** | A string containing a 64-bit unsigned integer.  We represent u64 values as a string to ensure compatibility with languages such as JavaScript that do not parse u64s in JSON natively.  | 
**accountAddress** | **String** | A hex encoded 32 byte Aptos account address.  This is represented in a string as a 64 character hex string, sometimes shortened by stripping leading 0s, and adding a 0x.  For example, address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 is represented as 0x1.  |
